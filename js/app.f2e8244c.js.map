They are common practices in software engineering that aim at improving the overall quality of the software during the development life cycle. CI/CD encompass both the verification and validation (V&V) processes, and thus they not only act at the code level, but also assess the operational part of the software. Consequently, CI/CD helps developers to meet both the functional (behavior-driven) and non-functional (usability-oriented) requirements that the software is intended to provide to their users.</p>\r\n          <h4 style=\"font-weight: 700;color:#73bbdc;margin-top: 0px;\">What about the <em>Pipelines</em>?</h4>\r\n          <p>The CI/CD work is commonly arranged into pipelines, which define the sequential steps that the software V&V needs to go through, commonly as often as new source code changes are added to the codebase. As a result, automation is key to enable the CI/CD scenarios and a key feature of the pipelines.</p>\r\n          <h2 style=\"font-weight: 700;color:#73bbdc;margin-top: 0px;\">What are SQAaaS <em>digital badges</em> all about?</h2>\r\n          <p>Badges are commonly used by earners for proving the attainment of certain achievements. Digital badges complement traditional badging by providing virtual certification with built-in features for online sharing, verification, portability and trustworthiness. The SQAaaS platform harnesses the potential of the Open Badges specification to issue digital badges for particular versions of the software. Each badge issued by SQAaaS has associated metadata that includes the software quality criteria being fulfilled and the applicable evidence in the form of build logs, reports and/or binary artefacts.</p>\r\n          <h4 style=\"font-weight: 700;color:#73bbdc;margin-top: 0px;\">How can software in research benefit from badges?</h4>\r\n          <p>The resultant badge can then be shared and verified by external bodies, thus significantly impacting the visibility and adoption of the software. In research ecosystems, such a quality badge definitely contributes to usability, reputation-building and crediting, as well as improving the reusability and reproducibility of the awarded software version.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <section class=\"bg-blue section-style\">\r\n        <div class=\"container\" style=\"padding-top:0px;\" id=\"badges\" ref=\"badges\">\r\n          <h2 style=\"font-weight: 700;color:#ffff;margin-top: 0px;\">Benefit from the good practices when developing software and services</h2>\r\n          <h4 style=\"font-weight: 700;padding-bottom:0.2rem;\">Meet the quality criteria we use to foster the implementation of reproducible and sustainable research software.</h4>\r\n          <p>The workflow of the CI/CD pipelines created by the SQAaaS platform is criteria-driven, which means that each stage executed by the pipeline fulfills a criterion from the two sets of Software and Service Quality Assurance documents.
