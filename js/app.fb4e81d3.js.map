They are common practices in software engineering that aim at improving the overall quality of the software during the development life cycle. CI/CD encompass both the verification and validation (V&V) processes, and thus they not only act at the code level, but also assess the operational part of the software. Consequently, CI/CD helps developers to meet both the functional (behavior-driven) and non-functional (usability-oriented) requirements that the software is intended to provide to their users.</p>\r\n      <h4>What about the Pipelines?</h4>\r\n      <p>The CI/CD work is commonly arranged into pipelines, which define the sequential steps that the software V&V needs to go through, commonly as often as new source code changes are added to the codebase. As a result, automation is key to enable the CI/CD scenarios and a key feature of the pipelines.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"section intro\">\r\n      <h2>What are SQAaaS digital badges all about?</h2>\r\n      <p>Badges are commonly used by earners for proving the attainment of certain achievements. Digital badges complement traditional badging by providing virtual certification with built-in features for online sharing, verification, portability and trustworthiness. The SQAaaS platform harnesses the potential of the Open Badges specification to issue digital badges for particular versions of the software. Each badge issued by SQAaaS has associated metadata that includes the software quality criteria being fulfilled and the applicable evidence in the form of build logs, reports and/or binary artefacts.</p>\r\n      <h4>How can software in research benefit from badges?</h4>\r\n      <p>The resultant badge can then be shared and verified by external bodies, thus significantly impacting the visibility and adoption of the software.
